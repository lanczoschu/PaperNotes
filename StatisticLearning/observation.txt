\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12336}{CXPlain}, an explanation method with uncertainty, 
inspires us to test the explantion variation of current methods. 
There is a natural assumption: whether the more important nodes have lower std value. 
  \par  
We observe that for signal nodes, the importance scores' variation is perfectly decreasing with the importance scores' magnitude.
For background nodes, the correlation varies a lot across different classifiers. 
  \par 
Another observation is that if auc performance is relatively high (>90), then use negative importance scores' std value's 
can get comparable performance.
